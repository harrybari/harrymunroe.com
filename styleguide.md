HarryMunroe.com — Style Guide

This document defines the design, tone, and structural rules for harrymunroe.com.
Its purpose is to keep the site coherent, calm, and inviting as it grows over time.

If something feels impressive but violates this guide, it does not belong.

1. Purpose of the Site
This site is a front door to my thinking.
Its goal is to help thoughtful people feel:
hopeful about the future,
curious rather than intimidated,
safe asking questions they don’t yet know how to phrase.
The site privileges clarity, context, and curiosity over speed, output, or performance.

2. Core Style Statement
This site should feel like a calm room where complex ideas are worked through in public.
Typography does the heavy lifting.
Color is restrained but expressive.
Structure is clear, but edges are intentionally soft.
Moments of enthusiasm and play appear sparingly, as invitations rather than declarations.
The work is serious, but never severe.

3. Typography Rules
Typography is the primary emotional signal of the site.
3.1 Headlines
Headlines should be bold, confident, and architectural
No decorative fonts
No all-caps
Fewer words, more weight
Headlines should feel like pauses, not shouts.
3.2 Body Text
Warm, readable sans-serif
Generous line height
Comfortable for slow reading
Never compressed to fit more content
Body text should invite lingering.
3.3 Enthusiasm & Asides
Italics are used for:
enthusiasm
side thoughts
gentle emphasis
Sentence fragments are allowed
Em dashes are welcome
Avoid:
emojis
excessive exclamation points
performative excitement
Enthusiasm should feel contained, not loud.

4. Color System
Color is used for expression, not decoration.
4.1 Palette
Calm, cool neutrals for backgrounds
Dark charcoal for text
One expressive accent color only
The accent color signals attention but should never dominate.
4.2 Accent Color Usage
Accent color may be used for:
links
underlines
hover states
subtle dividers
section markers
Accent color may not be used for:
large background blocks
full sections
urgency signaling
4.3 Emotional Constraint
Color should never communicate:
urgency
danger
sales pressure
Nothing on the site should feel demanding.

5. Layout & Structure Rules
5.1 Discipline First
Most of the site should feel:
aligned
predictable
spacious
intentional
The grid is real, even if it’s invisible.
5.2 One Place to Break the Grid
Each page may have one layer that feels softer or messier:
topic clusters
thinking tables
overlapping blocks
offset cards
Mess is intentional, not accidental.
5.3 White Space Is Functional
White space:
creates calm
signals importance
invites engagement
If something feels crowded, remove content — don’t tighten spacing.

6. Content Organization
6.1 No Feeds on the Homepage
The homepage must remain timeless.
Avoid:
“latest posts”
timestamps
content counts
update signals
Orientation > recency.
6.2 Topics Over Formats
Content is organized by ideas, not outputs.
Writing and video coexist
No “Videos” tab
No “Projects” tab
Topics are the primary navigation.
6.3 Topic Pages as Thinking Tables
Topic pages should feel:
non-linear
skimmable
provisional
conversational
They are not essays.
They are surfaces for thought.
6.4 Every Page Has One Job
Each page should clearly answer one question.
If the question isn’t obvious, the page isn’t ready.

7. Language & Tone Rules
7.1 Permission Over Authority
Default tone should:
welcome beginners
normalize uncertainty
avoid posturing
Preferred phrasing:
“A useful way to think about this…”
“One interpretation I find helpful…”
“This is still forming for me…”
7.2 Jargon Must Earn Its Place
If a technical term is used, it must be:
defined,
contextualized, or
linked to an explanation.
Assumed knowledge is discouraged.
7.3 Unfinished Is a Feature
Signals of intentional unfinishedness are encouraged:
open questions
provisional language
evolving posts
revisions over time
The site should feel alive, not finalized.

9. Final Litmus Test
Before adding anything to the site, ask:
Does this make the reader feel more hopeful, more curious, and less afraid of asking a question?
If yes → it belongs.
If no → it doesn’t matter how impressive it is.
